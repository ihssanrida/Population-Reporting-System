### **Code of Conduct for the Population Reporting System Project** 

This **Code of Conduct** establishes guidelines to maintain professionalism, quality, and consistency within the **Population Reporting System** project. It outlines expectations for code quality, task management, communication, security practices, and project documentation.

---

## **1. Purpose**

This Code of Conduct serves to ensure that all aspects of this project are managed professionally and that the codebase adheres to best practices for maintainability, readability, and security. These standards are designed to promote accountability and clarity throughout the development process.

---

## **2. Code Quality and Standards**

1. **Code Consistency**  
   - Follow a consistent style for code organization and naming conventions:
     - **JavaScript**: Use `camelCase` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for classes, and use `const` or `let` 
     - **HTML/PUG**: Structure markup semantically with indentation and well-defined class names.
     - **CSS**: Use meaningful class names and keep styles modular with reusable components.

2. **Documentation**  
   - **Code Comments**: Comment code to explain logic.
   - **README**: Maintain an up-to-date **README** file with project setup instructions, usage guidelines, and deployment details.
 

3. **Testing and Code Review**  
   - Perform testing on all new features, routes, and data handling functions.
   - Review code periodically to ensure alignment with project requirements and to identify improvements.
   - Ensure any discovered issues are logged and addressed within the task tracking system.

## **3. Project Management**

1. **Task Management and Tracking**  
   - **Use Zube.io**: Track all tasks using Zube.io with organized boards for Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, and Done.
   - **Task Descriptions**: Ensure each task has a descriptive title, clear objectives, and acceptance criteria.
   - **Epics and Sprints**: Organize tasks into relevant epics such as  Country and City Reports and also assign to specific sprints based on project priorities.

2. **Commit Frequency and Naming Conventions**  
   - **Commit Often**: Make frequent commits with meaningful messages to capture development progress.
   - **Commit Messages**: Use descriptive messages following the format: `[Type]: [Brief description]`. Examples:
     - `feat: add Top N functionality for city reports`
     - `fix: correct database connection pooling`
   - **Branch Naming**: Use branches for features, bug fixes, or major updates (e.g., `feature/top-N-countries`, `bugfix/connection-issue`).

---

## **4. Communication and Collaboration**

1. **Self-Review and Reflection**  
   - After each sprint, reflect on progress and improvements, recording any lessons learned.
   - Regularly review code quality, checking for adherence to standards and identifying areas for optimization.

2. **Deadline and Time Management**  
   - Set realistic deadlines for each task based on sprint goals.
   - If a deadline cannot be met, document the cause and adjust the timeline, noting any changes in task dependencies.

3. **Transparency and Documentation of Changes**  
   - Document significant changes or challenges encountered in the project, updating task descriptions or adding comments in Zube.io for traceability.

---

## **5. Security and Privacy**

1. **Data Security**  
   - **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` files for sensitive data such as database connection credentials and add `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent exposure in version control.
   - **Sensitive Information**: Avoid hardcoding sensitive data directly in the codebase. Always handle sensitive information with care.

2. **Error Handling and Logging**  
   - Ensure all routes and database interactions have proper error handling.
   - Avoid logging sensitive data.

3. **Security Best Practices**  
   - Use prepared statements  to protect against SQL injection.
   - Regularly review dependencies and apply security patches as needed.

---

## **6. Documentation and Maintenance**

1. **README File**  
   - The README should include:
     - Project overview and purpose.
     - Setup and installation instructions.
     - Usage instructions for both development and production environments.
     - Deployment guidelines.


2. **Periodic Code Review and Refactoring**  
   - Schedule periodic code reviews to ensure the codebase remains clean, functional, and adheres to best practices.
   - Refactor code where necessary to improve readability, performance, or security.
